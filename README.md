ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR Game Project!

This game has been designed for:mobile,using DOM manipulation through javascript.

WITHOUT  CSS media querys,

and is part of The Odin Project course.

Like an EXTRA function a Real Time Translate Button was added on the Project.

All the logic was made by me.I create 2 dictionaries using 2 arrays to make it work, also the translation its in real time.
